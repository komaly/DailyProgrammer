According to Goldbachâ€™s weak conjecture, every odd number greater than 5 can be expressed 
as the sum of three prime numbers. (A prime may be used more than once in the same sum.)

This program applies Goldbach's weak conjecture to numbers and shows which 3 primes, 
added together, yield the result.

Example:
Input: 11
Output: 2 + 2 + 7
