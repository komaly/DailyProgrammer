This program has two functions. The first, funnel, takes two strings of letters and determines whether the 
second can be made from the first by removing one letter. The remaining letters must stay in the same order.
The second function, bonus, takes a string and finds all words from the enable1.txt file that can be made by 
removing one letter from the string. 

This program is an answer to Reddits Daily Programer Challenge #366, found here:

This is also my first Daily Programmer done in Ruby.
