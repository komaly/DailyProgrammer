This program takes a file with a pyramid in it. The first line of the file is a number indicating the 
total height of the pyramid, while the rest of the file is the pyramid itself. The program finds the quickest
way down the pyramid, when only going directly down from the current number or directly down and to the right
of the number. The program outputs the sum of the shortest path down the pyramid.
