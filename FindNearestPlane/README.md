Given the latitude and longitude of a location, this program displays the information of the plane closest to
the given location. Plane information is retrieved using the OpenSky's Network API. 

The distance between the given location and a plane is calculated using the Geodesic Distance Formula 
(see here for more information: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great-circle_distance). The Euclidean 
distance between the location and planeis calculated and displayed as well (see here for more information:
 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance).
