For this program, you must calculate the monthly commission of each sales person in 
a sales team.

Sales people get paid using the following formula for the total commission: commission is 6.2% of 
profit, with no commission for any product to total less than zero.

Given two matrices showing the sales figure per sales person for each product they sold, and the 
expenses by product per salesperson, calculate the commission for each sales person.

Example input:
Revenue 

        Frank   Jane
Tea       120    145
Coffee    243    265

Expenses

        Frank   Jane
Tea       130     59
Coffee    143    198

Example output:
                 Frank   Jane
Commission       6.20   9.49
