For this program, you must calculate the monthly commission of each sales person in 
a sales team.

Sales people get paid using the following formula for the total commission: commission is 6.2% of 
profit, with no commission for any product to total less than zero.

Given two matrices showing the sales figure per sales person for each product they sold, and the 
expenses by product per salesperson (input file), calculate the commission for each sales person (output file).
