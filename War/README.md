The objective of the game War is to win all the cards. The deck is divided evenly among 
the players, giving each a deck of face-down cards. In unison, each player reveals the top 
card of their deck – this is a battle – and the player with the higher card adds both cards 
to the bottom of their deck. If the cards are of equal value, it's war!

During a war, both players place their next three cards face down, then a card face-up. The 
owner of the higher face-up card wins the war and adds all cards on the table to the bottom 
of their deck. If the face-up cards are again equal then the war repeats with another set of 
face-down/up cards, until one player's face-up card is higher than their opponent's, or both 
players run out of cards

This process is repeated until one player wins all the cards - this player is declared the winner.
