This program reads a text file with Banker's Algorithm and outputs the order that
the processes should go in. The first line of the file contains three numbers, dubbed the available vector,
and the rest of the lines contain six numbers and are divided into two parts. The first half of the line
indicates the number of resources of each type currently allocated at that process (the allocation matrix) 
and the second half of the line indicates the maximum demand of each type for each process (the max matrix).
